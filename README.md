# Local Storage Browser
A package library useful for accessing API of local storage in browser.

The `localStorage` read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.

`localStorage` is similar to `sessionStorage`, except that while `localStorage` data has no expiration time, `sessionStorage` data gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. (`localStorage` data for a document loaded in a "*private browsing*" or "*incognito*" session is cleared when the last "*private*" tab is closed.)
